## 📚 Theory & Foundations

- [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) – Richard Dawkins (1976), coined the term "meme" as a replicator in cultural evolution.
- [Thought Contagion](https://archive.org/details/thoughtcontagion0000lync_c9w6) – Aaron Lynch (1996), mathematical treatment of memetic spread.
- [Viruses of the Mind](https://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/pmo/eng/Dawkins-MindViruses.pdf) – Dawkins’ essay exploring memes as parasitic cognitive entities.
- [The Meme Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meme_Machine) – Susan Blackmore, expands on Dawkins with memetic theory as a framework for consciousness and culture.

## 🧠 Academic Papers

- [MOSAIC:Modeling Social AI for Content Dissemination and Regulation in Multi-Agent Simulations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07830) - The MOSAIC framework introduces a generative, multi-agent simulation using LLM-powered personas to model social network behavior, including content sharing, flagging, and misinformation spread. It evaluates moderation strategies that both reduce misinformation and boost engagement, while revealing a mismatch between agents’ stated reasoning and actual behavior. The open-source project offers a scalable tool for studying online dynamics and AI-driven content ecosystems.


## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

[MOSAIC-submission](https://github.com/AnonymousPaperRepo/MOSAIC-submission) - a framework for simulating social media dynamics using AI agents with configurable personalities and behaviors. The simulation can be used to study the spread of information, misinformation, and the effects of various moderation strategies.
